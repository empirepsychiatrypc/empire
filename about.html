          <span class="bigger"> Let me tell you a story.</span><p>A story
          involving two brothers… <p>Joel, an Emergency Room Nurse, and Jacob, a
          Pharmacist. <p>Both noticed, through thousands of patient encounters,
          that there were more options for medical practitioners than ever,
          greater access to medical care for everyone, astounding new
          technologies in the health field… </p><p> But still… </p><p>Patients with mental
          health needs were experiencing major problems.</p><p> These patients were
          being under-served in a big way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Patients with mental health needs—ranging from anxiety and depression
          to bipolar, schizophrenia and ADHD—were being mismanaged with:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sub-par therapies</li>
          <li>Inattentive practitioners</li>
          <li>Long wait times (sometimes months!)</li>
          <li>And a lack of practitioners that accept insurance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These patients were successful CEOs, mothers on the PTA, high school
          and college students, and everyday people who simply could not find
          adequate treatment for mental health issues they were facing, large or
          small.
        </p>

        <h3>
          They all experienced the same difficulties when starting with
          psychiatric practitioners.
        </h3>
        <p>Why was this the case?</p>
        <p>
          Why has this field of mental health not caught up to its counterparts?
        </p>
        <p>
          Jacob and Joel set out to understand why - and improve these
          inadequacies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joel, already an accomplished Emergency Room Nurse, spent three years
          becoming a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, and four more years honing
          his expertise in the art and science of psychiatry—learning functional
          and integrative psychiatric approaches and participating in inpatient
          and outpatient clinics—treating everything from complex cases to the
          everyday mental health issues that affect so many of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jacob, the Pharmacist, delved into the world of psychiatry and studied
          drug interactions, optimal medication management, and evaluated the
          latest clinical trials examining the effectiveness of each medication,
          as well as side effects—and how to manage and mitigate them. He became
          a consultant for psychiatric practitioners on cases ranging from the
          mundane to the elaborate, involving multiple disorders and
          co-morbidities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started our psychiatric group with a different perspective. Our one
          goal:
        </p>
        <p>
          Improve psychiatric care for our everyday patients being under-served
          by this broken system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you’re visiting a psychiatric practitioner for the first time,
          or you’ve gone to other practitioners before, searching for a provider
          is a challenge no one should face alone.
        </p>
        <p>And so…</p>
        <p>
          We’ve created a system based on our experience with thousands of
          patients to provide a service that takes the stress out of getting the
          care you need:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A psychiatric provider who cares enough to listen and holistically
            understand your situation, instead of simply throwing medication at
            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Someone who gives you adequate time to recount your history, express
            your feelings, and describe the symptoms you’re having without
            feeling rushed.
          </li>
          <li>Someone warm, empathetic and compassionate.</li>
          <li>
            A practitioner who won’t over-medicate you, and will use therapies
            you are comfortable with - explaining in detail the ‘Why’ behind
            your care plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Someone who will remember you in your next visit, and doesn’t treat
            you like just one more patient on a busy roster.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After all, putting your trust in a psychiatric practitioner is no
          small thing.
        </p>
        <p>You may be trusting them to lead you out of a very dark place.</p>
        <p>
          Or perhaps you want someone to simply guide you through a short period
          of your life, getting you unstuck from a mental rut you’re currently
          experiencing.
        </p>
        <h4>It’s no small matter to lay yourself bare and be vulnerable.</h4>
        <p>
          That’s why we developed our practice in such a way to address the
          issues patients face.
        </p>
        <p>And one that patients can afford.</p>
        <p>
          You also know that most psychiatric practitioners don’t accept
          insurance; or only a few exclusive plans - limiting your options for
          the help you want.
        </p>
        <p class="underLine">
          It’s why we participate with most major insurance carriers, and for
          the few that we don’t, our private pay rates are extremely reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, on top of the worries you’re experiencing, you don’t need
          to worry about how you’ll pay for the excellent care you’re getting.
        </p>
        <p>Our team encompasses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a Psychiatrist</li>
          <li>a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner</li>
          <li>a Psychiatric Physician Assistant</li>
          <li>and a Pharmacist</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All our providers are Board Certified in Psychiatry.</p>
        <p>
          We keep our practice small and family-like, so we have more time with
          patients, greater collaboration, and a prime work environment.
        </p>
        <p>We love what we do and our patients clearly see it.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p class="cursive">Dr. Jacob Wartenberg</p>
        <p>Dr. Jacob Wartenberg PharmD., MBA-HSA</p>
        <p class="cursive">Joel Wartenberg</p>
   <p>Joel Wartenberg, BSN, MSN, PMHNP-BC</p>
