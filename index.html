                    I was having. I decided to get treatment by Empire for what I thought was insomnia,
                    but after my first meeting I was diagnosed with depression. By targeting my
                    depression, my other symptoms got so much better. I have more energy, and my
                    mental clarity is the way it used to be years ago. Thank you for such a thorough
                    assessment, and for knowing how to treat me better than I would’ve ever thought.”</p>

                  has been amazing, and I finally see a path towards normalcy. The entire staff is so
                  warm and welcoming and made me feel at ease. Highly recommend.”</p>

                  therapy and guidance, and a ton of hard work. I never thought I could take the steps
                  to get better until I came here and started treatment at Empire. Things are still a
                  challenge for me, but I have come so far under their care. I am so grateful.”</p>

                me on, and switched to only a couple that make such a improvement in my
                symptoms. The difference with Empire is night and day.”</p>
