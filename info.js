    body: `<p><span class="big">You have assignments due</span>, reports to finish and a multitude of other life chores to complete in our fast-paced world. You know what you have to do and you’re smart enough to do it. Yet you can’t focus on one thing for more than a few moments. It’s frustrating living with ADHD. Sometimes you may want to pay attention to a task for more than a couple minutes and end up realizing you got distracted with something else a minute ago.</p> <p>ADHD doesn’t always manifest itself like shown on Television, especially in adult patients. It’s not simply having a fly in your field of vision and becoming distracted. We like to equate it as your brain being an internet browser with too many tabs open. Often, ADHD can feel like endless rivers of thoughts chained together through association, with a dollop of imagination thrown in.</p> <p> These symptoms are not detrimental in of itself; however, with life throwing so many obstacles and to-do lists our way, it’s important to be able to prioritize. Finishing a report might constitute as an 8 on the importance scale, taking out the garbage could be a 4, and checking your email a 3. ADHD can feel like every one of those is a huge blaring 10 - leaving you scrambling in various directions all at once. Many of our patients have only some of these symptoms, but not others - and some have all those described above. It’s why we tailor a specific treatment plan to each individual patient, achieving the most reasonable and effective balance that allows YOU to live the best life you can.</p>`

    body: `<p><span class="big">Anxiety is a normal part of living.</span> Everyone has anxiety to varying degrees. It
    manifests physically as your heart beating fast, your face red and flushing, stomach
    roiling, hands shaking and clammy. It’s the feeling you get at the start of a roller
    coaster. But no one wants that feeling all day long. Or when socializing with others.
    Or simply when it stops us from engaging in everyday activities. So how do we judge
    when the anxiety we feel isn’t normal? It’s this uncertainty that keeps many patients
    from seeking help…</p> <p>Anxiety manifests in a multitude of ways that are often not realized. For example,
    having low self-confidence or self-esteem and constantly beating yourself up over
    everything you do or say. Never sharing your opinions or emotions due to fear of
    ridicule or embarrassment. Avoiding situations that make you nervous, like dating
    and relationships. Getting caught in a spiral of negative thoughts that leave you
    feeling terrible about yourself. Feeling like you&#39;re not loved or appreciated; just a
    burden to people. An inability to relax or lower your inhibitions. When something
    embarrassing or bad happens, you can&#39;t stop thinking about it. Trouble falling asleep,
    trouble waking up, and feeling tired throughout the day. Obsessing over your mental
    condition. And many of our patients we treat first come in thinking they’re the only
    ones to feel this way. If they only knew!</p> <p>Every person is unique with a different set of life experiences and hurdles. It’s why
    we carry out a thorough and detailed assessment to create an individualized
    treatment plan that helps alleviate the specific issues that YOU are facing. No cookie-

let bip = {
    title: "Bipolar",
    body: `<p><span class="big">Bipolar disorder is one of the most </span> commonly misunderstand conditions in the
    mental health arena. It’s portrayed in movies, TV, news, and pop culture. It’s also
    often misdiagnosed, making bipolar disorder tricky to manage. It takes an average of
    10 years after symptom onset to receive the correct diagnosis. This is because mania
    is the hallmark of bipolar disorder, and the depressive episodes often times get
    overlooked. In fact, people with bipolar disorder typically spend much more time
    depressed than manic, and even years of depression may go by between manic
    episodes. There is also Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Cyclothymic disorder to add to the
    confusion. Additionally, there are mixed states where a person can be both manic
    and depressed.</p> <p>So what does mania feel like?…</p> <p>It can feel like the best night out getting intoxicated. You lose your inhibitions, your
    morals change. You have to buy that new car/purse/watch you’re fixated on, right
    NOW. You’re on top of the world and you don’t want it to end.</p> <p>During a HYPOmanic state you can be funny, fast, outspoken, creative, spiritual and
    interested in many things and people. You get projects done on little sleep, are more
    efficient than ever, and generally you feel fantastic. While not as extreme as a
    normal manic episode, you are still in a somewhat euphoric state.</p> <p>The depression that inevitably follows these states is profound. Your mind starts
    telling you that you are worthless. Joy and happiness become an impossibility so why
    even bother doing anything at all? - and life suddenly loses meaning. Sluggishness,
    and general weakness make it extremely difficult getting out of bed.</p> <p>A mixed state leaves you mostly irritated, angry, anxious and depressed all at the
    same time. There is no fun or flights of fancy here.</p> <p>Bipolar is a spectrum, and each person has varying core symptoms he/she
    experiences. The good news is that with the right medication and therapies, you can
    live a proactive and fulfilled life. But a thorough and detailed evaluation has to be
    done, and a specialized treatment plan must be created for each individual. It’s why
    we evaluate YOU, not just the condition, to create the best therapies to allow you to
    live up to your potential.</p>`

    title: 'Depression',
    body: `<p><span class="big">It’s difficult for people without depression</span> to truly understand what it feels like. “Just
    be thankful for what you have!”, or, “Fight through it and and focus on the positive.”
    These end up making you feel even worse. Yes, you want to fight it. Yes, you
    understand on a certain level that there is what to be happy for. But you have
    depression, so none of that makes a difference. And being told that you can will your
    way out of it reminds you that someone without this affliction can’t truly understand
    what it feels like.</p> <p>Depression can continue for days, months, and even years until you may look back
    and realize your relationships and health have fallen apart. You’ve given up on things
    you were once passionate about, walking away from many of life’s opportunities
    that were sent your way. It’s understandable, and here’s why…</p> <p>Depression can manifest differently for every person, but there are a few common
    thought patterns, feelings, and physical manifestations that are hallmarks of
    depression. The hallmark symptom is a loss of joy and happiness for things that
    previously gave you those feelings. You may have a complete lack of motivation to
    do anything. Your mind and body “shut down” and you watch the day pass at a
    snail’s pace. You lose interest in friendships, not because you don’t like your friends,
    but you simply can’t burden yourself with other people’s emotions while struggling
    to deal with your own. When you wake up you ask yourself “what’s the point of
    getting out of bed?” You feel as though you literally don&#39;t have the strength to get up
    and face the day…</p> <p>It’s trying to laugh at a joke that isn&#39;t funny; trying to smile for a photo you don&#39;t
    want to be in. It’s having no feelings, which can be worse than feeling sad or angry -
    you want to be angry, but simply don&#39;t have the emotional strength for it. You either
    over-eat, or barely eat anything at all from a complete lack of appetite. There are
    levels to depression and you may have some or all of of the above, and maybe just a
    mild version of it. Everyone has their own unique experience, and that’s why it’s very
    important to us to know exactly what YOU’RE going through.</p> <p>The good news is you’ve taken the very difficult step of seeking help and finding
    treatment. Or maybe you’ve been to other practitioners before, but you weren’t
    helped the way you thought you’d be. We understand. But you’re here now, and we
    can help you. Depression can be managed and treated. Our hundreds of patients
    who are living better than they ever thought possible are a testament to that. Reach

let schiz = {
    title: 'Schizophrenia',
    body: `<p><span class="big">Below is what Schizophrenia can feel like</span>. It’s important to note that severity differs between individuals, and everyone's experiences is unique.

 

    Paranoia. You're not worried your co-workers are plotting to kill you. You know your co-workers are plotting to kill you. Even If there’s someplace inside you that knows it’s part of the condition, you can’t shake the certainty. For anyone without this disorder, imagine feeling like everyone is trying to harm or kill you, literally. Think about what kind of fear you’d live with everyday.
    
     
    
    Delusions. The songs on the radio are always about what you did recently and contain veiled messages, sometimes threats. The celebrities on TV and Youtube talk about you without speaking your name. There’s significance in everything around you and it all ties together. You always feel like you’re on the brink of figuring it all out. You don't know why so many people obsess over you, or why everyone around you is ‘in on it’ and lying about what they see. But you’re always so close to understanding why you were chosen and what everyone wants you to do. Your mind will come up with people and scenarios that aren’t real, but these circulate in your head so often you begin thinking that a person is real, or that something actually happened. It makes it difficult to tell reality from fiction.
    
     
    
     
    
    Hallucinations. The voices can be hushed and whisper things that you can’t make sense of, but sometimes it gets so loud that you can’t focus on anything and you feel detached. Often times, they're pretty negative, telling you you’re stupid, worthless, that nobody likes you, that everything you do is pointless. It's having every insecurity about yourself constantly ringing in your ears. This makes having healthy self-esteem quite difficult.
    
     
    
    Fear. You feel nothing and everything. Like you always have to watch your back and always have to be alert. It’s your greatest fear and no matter what you do, no matter what anyone says, you know in your head and heart that it will come to you and your fear will be realized. You feel this everyday.
    
     
    
     
    
    These are just some of the symptoms and experiences that our patients go through. Schizophrenia is a serious, debilitating affliction to live with. Most people hear the stories of failure, but there are plenty of successes. It’s not easy to control this disease. There are ups and downs and battles waged in the course of this condition. But it is possible to become stable and have relationships. We understand the disorder and what you’re experiencing. Everyone has a varying level of severity and differing symptoms. Our treatment will be individualized to you and aim to give you back your life.</p>`

    title: 'Panick Attack',
    body: `<p><span class="big">It starts as a little tingly feeling</span> in the back of your brain. A warm sensation. On its
    own, it can almost feel nice for a second. But the warmth turns red-hot, it burns and
    starts spreading. And it reaches your heart and your fingers and your legs, and you
    know that you’re dying. It squeezes you like a vise. “This is the end”, you think. Heart
    pounding out of your chest, you can’t breathe. “I’m losing control, am I going to pass
    out? I’m going to die! I’m going insane!” You grasp for a cohesive thought that will
    bring you out of this state, but you can&#39;t focus. And one of the worst parts - the fear
    that builds asking yourself “when is the next time this happens?”</p> <p>Panic Attacks aren’t dangerous in of themselves, but try telling yourself that while
    experiencing one. It’s an extremely scary and, often times, traumatic experience.
    And not uncommon, either. But when you suffer from panic attacks you don’t see
    the others around you that share your pain. Because panic attacks arise and abate
    rather quickly, so you don’t catch many strangers having them. This can make you
    feel like you’re one of the few struggling with this. We treat anxiety and panic all the
    time. In fact, it’s one of the most common conditions and symptoms we treat. And
    we don’t just push a medication your way and tell you to figure it out. While
    medication is an important part to healing, we educate you on how to heal yourself ,
    so you can be less dependant on medication in the future, and also just live to your
    full potential without having these symptoms weigh you down. We don’t simply put
    a band-aid on the problem, but rather we tackle this from multiple angles so that
    you can defeat this on your own.</p> `

    nightmares and outbursts that are often portrayed on TV.</p> <p>It can feel like you’re always on edge, irritable, uncomfortable around people, locked
    inside yourself, unable to just relax and have fun, unable to feel really positive
    feelings - and if you do, it&#39;s fleeting. All you want is to be yourself, the self you were
    before this changed you. It becomes difficult to understand how anyone can float
    through life doing their schoolwork, or focusing on their job, or going out to bars and
    social events and having fun, when there is so much pain and suffering, and that pain
    and suffering is now a part of you.</p> <p>PTSD can have a large effect on your personal life. To compensate for feeling on
    edge you may bottle up your emotions, which can affect your relationships with
    friends and loved ones. Things you say can come out very dry and almost
    uninterested, even though that’s not how you actually feel. Some may have
    disassociation, which can be extremely scary. Slowly your body starts to drift away
    from yourself, and you start losing control of what you can do. It can be described as
    an out of body experience. This can all lead to deep loneliness.</p> <p>This isn’t something that you can ‘just get over’ through will power. It involves
    reprogramming your brain which takes a lot of hard work! The good news is that it’s
    possible. Through therapy and medication and determined, consistent effort, you
    can heal yourself. You can find your voice again. And you can improve your life. We
    work with you and make sure to individualize your therapy so you can progress at
    your own pace, in a way that makes YOU feel comfortable.</p>`

    of grieving. You may feel shock at first. No crying, no sadness. Just numb. You may
    even feel like this for a few months. However, after a period of time the fog can lift
    and the grief can hit you like a tidal wave. Nearly anything associated with your loved
    one may make you cry, or feel alone or angry. The grief may come in waves. One
    minute you might think you’re doing okay, the next minute you might feel the need
    to break down. That’s okay. Let yourself go through the emotions. Years later you
    still may feel waves of grief during holidays or significant life events. Just remember
    to be kind to yourself.</p> <p>Having someone to talk to and understand the process of grief is important. If you

    multiple severity levels of OCD and different obsessions and compulsions that you
    could be dealing with.</p> <p>OCD feels like a losing battle against yourself; your brain is your own worst enemy.
    It’s a quest for control that is just out of reach. One of the most frustrating parts is
    you’re aware many of your obsessions aren’t practical. You fight it with logic, but it
    grows stronger. It absolutely will not listen to reason. It laughs at your evidence. It
    plays on your emotions. You want to beat it. You want to crush it - to simply kill it.
    Yet you struggle mightily. It’s exhausting and mentally draining to fight day in and
    day out.</p> <p>There’s checking, washing, counting, tapping, fear of contamination, doubt,
    symmetry, arranging, and unacceptable thoughts. And one of the worst parts is
    feeling alone with this condition. It’s very difficult for someone without OCD to
    deeply relate - and you see it in their eyes when you explain yourself…So you stop
    explaining, and start hiding. It becomes shameful. You know they won’t truly
    understand so why put yourself in a situation where you have to? You don’t go out
    as much, don’t live the life you want to. You know it’s irrational, but there’s a part of
    you that won&#39;t be willing to take the risk of quitting the ritual, just in case this is the
    one time that it isn’t OCD - and there&#39;s a very real threat. It’s the doom-and-gloom
    feeling that overcomes you if the compulsion is not allowed to manifest. And so it
    goes…</p> <p>But you’re not alone. There are many others out there suffering in similar ways. You
